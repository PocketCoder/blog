My biggest contention with this book is the misrepresentation of its contents the cover gave me. I know, I know: Never judge a book by its cover. But I did. And we do.

The UK cover¹ depicts two men aged between 18 and 25 kissing, so there's a fair assumption that the book would have characters roughly the same age as me (23). This was one of the main reasons I bought it. _Finally_, I thought, _a book about gay men my age, that aren't still in secondary school. A book that won't make me feel a loss for all that I didn't get to experience growing up. This one's about me!_ I knew it would have an element of coming out in it, that I was fine with, but I wanted to read about men

What I wanted:

- Men my age having sex
- Men my age having a relationship
- A relationship of my age, especially as I enter my first proper one. See how they navigate and talk and communicate.

Instead:

- A 16 year old couple
- Descriptions of a 15 year old's body and pubes?
- Sexual assault
  - Would've done better to deal with the after, rather than the before.
- Consequences of being gay, which I get there were back then, and sometimes now.
- Where's the Queer Joy? Especially after _Heartstopper_.
